        "Honkai Impact 3rd is set in an alternate version of Earth, plagued by catastrophes resulting from \"Honkai\" (in Chinese translates as \"Chaos\", while in Japanese, it is said \"Houkai\".). Honkai is largely viewed as a malevolent force with a will of its own, able to corrupt humans into undead creatures, manifest itself in the form of various monsters, and select various individuals known as \"Herrschers\" to imbue them with god-like powers able to trigger apocalyptic events. The Honkai is a cyclic phenomenon, returning to end civilization on Earth each time it gets too advanced - the Previous Era ended 50,000 years prior to the game's start, after the 14th Herrscher defeated humanity. In the present day, various global factions exist to combat or take advantage of the power of Honkai. These include \"Schicksal\", a European-based peacekeeping organization that deploys human warriors known as Valkyries to combat the Honkai; \"Anti-Entropy\", formerly the North American branch of Schicksal that objected to the use of human soldiers in favor of mechanized robots; and \"World Serpent\", a shadow organization manipulating events since the end of the Previous Era. Prior to the story's start, three Herrscher awakenings (or \"Impacts\") have occurred in the Current Era: the Herrscher of Reason who became the leader of Anti-Entropy instead of fighting humanity, the Herrscher of the Void who was defeated by Schicksal and Anti-Entropy in 2000, and the Herrscher of Thunder who was prevented from fully awakening and sent to train her powers as a Valkyrie at Schicksal's St. Freya Academy.\n",
        "Genshin Impact takes place in the world of Teyvat, and is composed of the seven major nations of Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhnaya; each nation is ruled by a different god.The mysterious floating island of Celestia is allegedly home to gods and mortals who have ascended to godhood through great, heroic feats. Underground lie the ruins of the nation of Khaenri'ah which was destroyed by gods 500 years before the events of the game. Unlike the seven major nations, Khaenri'ah was not ruled over by a god. The player character, the Traveler (male or female depending on the player's choice), is separated from their twin and becomes trapped in Teyvat. They are joined by a companion, Paimon, as they journey through Teyvat in search of their lost sibling. Although players can choose the name they want to be referred by, the Traveler's sibling refers to the Traveler by either Aether or Lumine, if the Traveler is male or female, respectively. Each nation is associated with and worships one of The Seven, a group of gods known as the \"Archons\", who each preside over one of the seven nations. Each member of The Seven is tied to one of the game's elements, and is also reflected in their nation's aspect. Barbatos, Rex Lapis, the Raiden Shogun and the Tsaritsa are the Archons of Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma and Snezhnaya, respectively However, the god who is the Archon may change over time as Archons pass away. Specific individuals chosen by the Archons are granted a Vision—magical gemstones that give their bearers the ability to command an element and the potential to ascend to godhood and reside in Celestia.\n",

        "In the past, three witches tried to come up with a great recipe for making magic cookies with ingredients such as Colorful sugar, butter, moonlight, Whisper's powder, and Life's powder. This gave birth to living cookies. They at first are delighted with the new world, but when they realized they're going to be eaten, they fled, leaving the witches with unbaked magical flour. But then, the batter gets exposed to sunlight over time, building more cookies. As generations passed, the 5 special cookies, Pure Vanilla, Hollyberry, Golden Cheese, Dark Cacao, & White Lily built their own civilizations. They are complemented with Soul Jams, which grant them eternal youth for them to rule in harmony. The witches, however, still have some Life powder, creating what is known as Cake Monsters. One day, a cookie seeks to know why they're made, & after seeing the horrible truth, gets plunged into the batter. That cookie came to be known as Dark Enchantress Cookie. She then leads the monsters to attack all of Earthbread. The Ancient Cookies join forces to fight her, only to get bested by the last minute & got their Soul Jam's taken. At that moment, Pure Vanilla Cookie uses his last remaining power to attack her, causing an explosion that leaves their fate unresolved. After that, their kingdoms had fallen with no realization of what happened. Centuries later, a new light had come by the name of Gingerbrave, as he left the oven & into a new era.\n",
        "Fate/Grand Order is a turn-based role-playing game with some visual novel elements. The player takes the role of a \"Master\" and commands a group of individuals called \"Servants\", who are typically historical, literary, and mythological figures from various cultures. The player commands a party composed of up to 6 Servants in each battle, 3 active members and 3 reserve members. In each turn, the player is given a set of 5 Command Cards and may use up to 3 of them in a turn to attack. Each Servant has 5 cards the player may use; the cards for all the Servants on the field are shuffled and dealt to the player each turn. The cards have three types: Buster (a heavy attack), Arts (a medium attack that charges a gauge for the Servant's \"Noble Phantasm\"), and Quick (a light attack that generates Critical Stars that increase the probability of critical hits next turn). If three similar cards are used in one turn, they create a \"Chain\" which gives a bonus based on the cards' properties. If three cards all corresponding to the same servant are selected, then a \"Brave Chain\" will ensue, resulting in an extra, more powerful, attack being added onto the end. Each Servant also has skills that can be used before drawing Command Cards; each skill gives effects in the battle, as well as a special command card called \"Noble Phantasm\" that appears when the gauge is full. The \"Master\" also has a separate set of skills and special abilities called \"Command Spells.\" Command Spells have a variety of effects and recharge based on real-world time.\n" + "\n",
        "Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game. However, there is an achievement system, known as \"advancements\" in the Java Edition of the game, and \"trophies\" on the PlayStation ports. Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person perspective. The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called \"blocks\"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can \"mine\" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things. Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic. The game also contains a material known as redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.\n",
        "Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a \"classic\" pistol and one or more \"signature ability\" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. It currently offers 19 agents to choose from. They are Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sova, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O, Chamber, Neon, and Fade.\n",
        "Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person shooter. Two opposing teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, compete in game modes to repeatedly complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or capturing hostages. At the end of each short round, players are rewarded based on individual and team performance with in-game currency to spend on other weapons or utility in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds generally rewards more money than losing does, and completing map-based objectives, including killing enemies, gives additional cash bonuses.",
        "As in previous Animal Crossing games, New Horizons is a life simulation game played in real time. Weather also adjusts to the seasons of the Northern or Southern Hemisphere, depending on the player's real-world location, a first for the Animal Crossing series. The game follows a villager customized by the player, who, after purchasing a getaway package from Tom Nook, moves into a deserted island. After Tom Nook gives the player essentials, such as a tent, the game proceeds in a non-linear fashion, allowing for the player to play the game as they choose. The player is given open access to natural resources such as fruit and wood, which can be collected and crafted into a variety of items and furniture known as D.I.Y. crafting. Alongside this, they can catch bugs and fish, plant and grow trees and flowers, extract natural resources such as rocks, and swim in the ocean. The island gives open space for placing items and decorating as the player chooses. Certain content available, such as organisms, are season-dependant and only appear for a limited time of the year. Doing simple tasks rewards the player with \"Nook Miles\", which in return can purchase premium rewards in Resident Services. The other currency \"Bells\", a staple in the Animal Crossing franchise, can be used to purchase other goods and services. Another feature offered early on is the \"Dodo Airlines\", an airport; through Dodo Airlines, and tickets purchased through Nook Miles, the player can visit other vacant islands to harvest resources, and meet other villagers. The player can invite other villagers they meet to their island if they choose.",
        "There are four official game modes: \"osu!\" (called \"osu!standard\"), \"osu!taiko\", \"osu!catch\", and \"osu!mania\".The original osu!standard mode remains the most popular to date and as of March 2022, the game has over 19.3 million monthly active users according to the game's global country leaderboards.\n" + "Each mode offers a variety of \"beatmaps\", which are game levels that are played to songs of different lengths, ranging from \"TV sized\" anime openings to \"marathons\" surpassing 7 minutes. In osu!standard, beatmaps consist of three items – hit circles, sliders, and spinners. The goal of the game is for the player to click on these items in time to the music. These items are collectively known as \"hit objects\" or \"Circles\", and are arranged in different positions on the screen (except for the spinner) at different points of time during a song. Taiko beatmaps have drumbeats and spinners. Catch beatmaps have fruits and spinners, which are arranged in a horizontally falling manner. Mania beatmaps consist of keys (depicted as a small bar) and holds. The beatmap is then played with accompanying music, simulating a sense of rhythm as the player interacts with the objects to the beat of the music. Each beatmap is accompanied by music and a background. The game can be played using various peripherals: the most common setup is a graphics tablet or computer mouse to control cursor movement, paired with a keyboard or a mini keyboard with only two keys, while the game's auto function (where the game itself plays the beatmap as accurate as possible) uses only the mouse to play osu!standard beatmaps, and only the keyboard for osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania beatmaps."
